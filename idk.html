    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <P>Hi, I'm Nick, I'm 14 (born in 2009). Originally, I'm from Batumi, Georgia, where I spent five years before moving to Tbilisi for better schools.<br>
        I've been at <em>Georgian American High School</em>since 1st grade.I got interested in programming when I was 10, thanks to my dad who introduced me to it with my first computer.<br>
        I started with Scratch, but it didn't really grab my attention. After a break, I tried learning <i>JavaScript</i>, but I found it pretty tough.<br> 
        Then, I switched to <i>Python</i>, which I found easier and more enjoyable.After taking a year-long break from programming, I decided to give it another go.<br>
        This time, I explored <i>HTML</i>, <i>CSS</i>, and <i>JavaScript</i> for backend development. I tried learning from YouTube tutorials, but I didn't make much progress.<br>
        That's when I turned to Coursera for a more structured learning experience. </P>
