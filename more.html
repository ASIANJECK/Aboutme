    <h1>Other things i have done</h1>
    <p>Besides programming, I've always had a passion for sports.<br>
       I've excelled in tennis, football, chess, swimming, and boxing, participating in competitions where I've secured 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places, particularly in tennis, football, and chess.<br>
       Additionally, I've tried my hand at dropshipping, but unfortunately, it didn't work out due to my location.<br>
       On the leisure side, I enjoy playing computer games such as Fortnite, Roblox, Minecraft, CSGO, Brawl Stars, and many others.</p>
